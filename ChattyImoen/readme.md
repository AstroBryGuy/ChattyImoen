# Chatty Imoen
A BG:EE mod by AstroBryGuy


## Introduction

In the original Baldur's Gate, Imoen was a late addition to the game. Unfortunately, this means that she has no banter dialogs or interactions with other NPCs. Her voice set was also cobbled together. This mod expands Imoen's voice set and adds interaction banters with other NPCs. It also has a component to change Imoen's portrait to one of three choices: BG1, SoD, or BG2.


## Components


### Chatty Imoen: Expanded Character Sounds

This components expands Imoen's character sounds using lines from BG2 and the BGEE tutorial. Some of her original BG1 sounds are also repurposed for interactions with other NPCs.

If you have kicked Imoen out of the party, she gets a voiced line when you start a conversation with her to rejoin the party.


### Chatty Imoen: Add NPC Interactions

This component adds Imoen to the INTERACT.2DA file, which controls the "non-dialog" banters that BG1 NPCs have. This component requires the Expanded Character Sounds component, otherwise Imoen will have nothing to say.

Also, this component gives Imoen a specific reaction to Garrick's death (no other NPC does).


### Chatty Imoen: Imoen Portrait Replacements

If you want Imoen to have a consistent portrait through BGEE and SoD, you can use this component to make all her character files use the same portrait. The options are:

1. Give Imoen her BG1 Portrait
2. Give Imoen her SoD Portrait
3. Give Imoen her BG2 Portrait
